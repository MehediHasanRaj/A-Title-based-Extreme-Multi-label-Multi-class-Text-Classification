# A-Title-based-Extreme-Multi-label-Multi-class-Text-Classification
•	A deep learning-based project to classify or annotate the labels with most relevant documents
•	A fully Natural Language Processing based project with more than 1 million documents
•	It can successfully categorize the documents only using the title of the documents without the full text.
•	Different types of Deep learning architectures are used, including MLP, CNN, LSTM, GRU.
•	The model gives competitive result with Full text.
